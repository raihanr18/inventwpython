# Python Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of solved exercises from the book "Python Programming Exercise, Gently Explained" by Al Sweigart. Each script demonstrates a solution to a different programming problem, designed to build and reinforce an understanding of fundamental Python concepts.

## Exercise Descriptions

#### `exercise1.py`
> This script covers basic input and output operations. It prints a "Hello, world!" message to the console, prompts for the user's name, and then provides a personalized greeting.

#### `exercise2.py`
> This module provides functions for temperature conversion. It contains functions to convert degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa.

#### `exercise3.py`
> This file contains functions to determine the parity of a number. The `isOdd` and `isEven` functions return a boolean value indicating whether a given number is odd or even.

#### `exercise4.py`
> This script covers geometric calculations. It provides functions to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle, as well as the volume and surface area of a rectangular prism.

#### `exercise5.py`
> An implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game. The script prints numbers up to a specified limit, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz", multiples of five with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

#### `exercise6.py`
> The function in this script adds the correct ordinal suffix to numbers (e.g., "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th"). It properly handles special cases such as 11, 12, and 13.

#### `exercise7.py`
> A simple script to display the ASCII character table. It iterates through the range of printable ASCII values and displays the numeric code along with its corresponding character.

#### `exercise8.py`
> This file is intended for exercises involving file read and write operations. It currently serves as a placeholder.
